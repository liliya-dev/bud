### To start dev server
### npm start

Please if you want to start node server on your localhost, to work with SQL DB give me the ip address, and i'll allow access for you. Because now data base is closed for side server 
requests. And change baseUrl constant address in 'src/helpers/constants.ts' from 'http://145.239.95.160:3002' to 'http://localhost:3002'. Or you can add your own data base with settings in mysqlConnection.js file.
